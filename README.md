### Compiler for Calculator Program

* This project is a <b>Compiler For Calculator Program </b>developed by <u>Rajan Patel, Shail Patel, Vraj Patel, and Karan Patwa</u> students of the Department of Information Technology at Dharmsinh Desai University.

### Description
* This project aims to develop a compiler for a calculator program. The project includes the implementation of the following components:

1. First & Follow: This component is used to generate the parsing table for the grammar of the calculator program. It includes examples to help understand the concept.

2. Draw DFA: This component is used to draw the DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) for the calculator program.

3. Scanner Phase in Lex: This component is used to implement the scanner phase in Lex. It includes the implementation of regular expressions for the tokens of the calculator program.

4. Yacc: This component is used to implement the parser phase of the calculator program using Yacc. It includes the implementation of the grammar rules for the calculator program.

### Getting Started
1. To run the lex file for ```scanner phase```
```
lex parse.l
gcc lex.yy.c
./a.out
```

2. To run ```yacc files```
```
yacc -d iml.y
cc y.tab.c lex.yy.c
./a.out
```
